# Proton Beam Radiotherapy Optimization

Welcome to the Proton Beam Radiotherapy Optimization repository.

This project contains a collection of functions and scripts that have been instrumental in research focused on optimizing Bragg peaks for proton beam radiotherapy.
I have created all this work in the Summer of 2022 where I worked in conjunction with Bath Institute of Mathematical Innovation as a first year student.

> **Note:** The code in this repository was not developed within a version-controlled environment. Consequently, you may find the structure and organization somewhat unrefined. However, it contains a substantial and valuable set of functions for proton therapy optimization, and I hope you find it useful.

## Repository Structure

This repository holds a wide range of functions and code snippets used in various stages of research. Please be aware that some files may contain experimental or legacy code.

### Key Components:
- **Optimization Functions**: Functions to adjust the parameters of Bragg peaks for optimal therapeutic outcomes.
- **Dose Calculation Algorithms**: Methods for calculating dose distributions in proton therapy.
- **Bragg Peak Analysis Tools**: Code for analyzing the characteristics of Bragg peaks, including their shape, energy deposition, and effectiveness.
- **Helper Functions**: Miscellaneous utility functions that support the core functionality and data processing.

## Documentation

Due to the unstructured nature of the repository, there is no unified code documentation at this time. However, key functions are documented in individual files, and additional details are provided in the accompanying PDF report.

## Research Summary

This repository supports research on optimizing Bragg peaks in proton beam radiotherapy. Optimizing Bragg peaks is crucial for achieving precision in radiation therapy, allowing for better targeting of tumors while minimizing damage to surrounding healthy tissue. The research encapsulated here explores techniques to maximize the therapeutic effectiveness of proton beams.
